# Mortgage Literate

Mortgage Literate is a tool for Loan Officers and Real Estate Agents to share financing strategies with their clients in a meaningful and digestible way. I understand firsthand the need for more advanced technological solutions in an industry that can, at times, feel set in its ways. The purpose of Mortgage Literate is to provide a resource that can educate homebuyers during their journey toward financial freedom. 

Users can create multiple financing options for their clients to compare rate, payment, and product options.

### Description

Mortgage Literate uses Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Bootstrap for design and deployment. Passport.js is used to handle authentication. Mortgage Literate aims to build an alternative resource that allows homebuyers to compare their financing options in a straighforward way. The app hosts the production database of users and their assocciated clients through Atlas MongoDB and is deployed using Heroku.
